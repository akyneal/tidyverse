# How to use dplyr-tidyverse

## **dplyr** package

The **dplyr** package makes these steps fast and easy:

* By constraining your options, it helps you think about your data manipulation challenges.
* It provides simple “verbs”, functions that correspond to the most common data manipulation tasks, to help you translate your thoughts into code.
* It uses efficient backends, so you spend less time waiting for the computer.
